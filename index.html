					<h3>about the dev:</h3>
					<p>Alex is the coolest guy you will ever meet. <br>
					   He lived a humble life in Idaho before he ran off to California. <br>
					   It isn't easy being queer in a state that worships Trump. <br>
					   Fun fact: Alex's best friend's father stormed the capitol on Jan. 6! <br>
					   He can't fly in planes anymore. Alex is a second year art major <br>
					   and is fascinated with queer rights and rats. You can follow his <br>
					   art on instagram at @fart_slayer_ where he makes comics, prints, and paintings! </p>
